   - Use multi-factor authentication for critical operations

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Maintain detailed logs of all system activities
   - Implement tamper-evident logging mechanisms

4. **Secure Communication**:
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Implement certificate pinning for mobile applications

### Transaction Integrity

1. **Multi-signature Approval**:
   - Require multiple approvals for high-value transactions
   - Implement time-locked transactions for added security

2. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Implement AI-based anomaly detection for transaction patterns
   - Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activities

3. **Secure Key Management**:
